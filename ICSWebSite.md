I worked on the ICS page project from Aug2021 untill Aug 2022. I took on various tasks from the github repository such as implementing a search bar, testing functions and code. For this project, I was working as a Part time Java Web Developer for the ICS department to help make changes to the ICS website. 

The website was written about 20 years ago, so we had to make some major changes. One of the challenges I took was turining all of the .jsp files into html files while maintaining the functionality and integrity of the .jsp page. This was daunting because some of the .jsp files were well over 500 lines of code. SO I picked piece by piece to try and translate each line and function into html, with fully functioning javascript. 

My first task I implemented a website controler that took on more of the back-end handling of the website such as getting to the proper page, web site functionality and much more. 

Unfortunatly, this project has sensative information, like student social security numbers, addresses and other credintials that I cannot shar the URL of this github repository. This was one of my favorite projects because of the time I had spent on it and all the things I learned as a Java Web Developer.
