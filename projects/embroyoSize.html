<p>The Embroyo Project was created to find a cheaper alternative to IVF, or Invitro. Invitro is artificial insimination of the sperm directly into the egg. It is for couples who have a hard time concieving. This is VERY expensive process, and we are trying to find a cheaper, yet safe alternative.</p>

<p>I am in charge of the Embroyo Size team, let me tell you a bit of what I have done</p>

<p>I will now take you into the steps into running the application</p>

<p>first,
you have to download the repository, run it on anaconda, and download the latest version of python.
Next, 
download the dependencies via pip install <insert dependencies="" here=""></insert></p>

<p>After that, 
the application should populate.</p>

<p>Drag a video and press the upload video button.</p>

<p>There you go, you can now train embroyos if you have the videos.</p>

<p>Whats next?
For this semester, we will be playing with new Neural Networks, possibly implementing one from scratch if time permits.</p>

<p>The application is difficult to run at times and I want to figure out a way that is straight forward and to the point.
Alot of my team embers have a hard time gettig the app to even run.
I want to take this out of the equation so we can get straight to work.</p>

<p>The team and I have sucessfully trained Neural Networks to pick oiut what Embroyos are of the correct size.
 We also pay attention to the Embroyo growth rate. 
 The project we also had to do some application testing and functional implementation.
 I personally created a button allowing the user for a final time vs growth to populate.
 This semester we are throwing the programs some flags and working on updating the application.
 Along with testing new Nural Networks with our embroyo data.</p>

<p>Update
  We configured the flag, I became the Application team leader, and I also implemented a button with screenshot capabilities.</p>

<p>Whats Next?
  Refactoring the program is key. There is alot of duplicate code that can be made into functions, or better yet functional programming.</p>
