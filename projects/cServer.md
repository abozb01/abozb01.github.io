This project took almost the entire semeste to implement. We had to do a number of different things to get the server to work correctly with the client.

I was in charge of making the creating the sockets for the pipes in the processes. 

Although very time consuming, it was a success and worth it. 

We also had to create different processes and forks for the sockets. 

This was done with alot of C code, debugging and carefull planning.
